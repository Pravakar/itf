# itf
(Integrated Test Framework)
itf is a framework developed using Selenium WebDriver, Java, TestNG, Jenkins & ReportNG.
Its unique advantage lies in the fact that this is designed in a module based format so that a suite of testcases ( for a particular module)  can be run depending on the requirement. Also this can be directly triggerd from Jenkins making it user friendly.
